# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Copy code blocks to clipboard** — rendered code blocks are numbered (`#1`, `#2`, …) in the block header. Press **Option+C** (macOS) / **Alt+C** (Linux) to instantly copy the last block without pressing Enter. Use `/copy [N]` or `/cp [N]` to copy a specific block by number; omit N to copy the last one. A brief inline confirmation shows language and block ID (`✓ typescript #3 copied`). Block store maintains up to 100 entries FIFO; IDs never reset within a session to avoid stale references. Invalid arguments (floats, non-numeric strings) produce a clear error instead of silently truncating.
- **Multi-image paste support** — each **Ctrl+V** or `/image` call now *accumulates* images instead of replacing the previous one. The prompt shows individual compact badges (`[📎 #1] [📎 #2]`) for each queued image so you can see exactly how many are pending. All images are sent in one agent turn when you press Enter.

### Fixed
- **Agent refuses to run `kubectl`, `gcloud`, `aws`, and other CLIs** — the model was hallucinating a technical limitation ("I don't have credentials"). `bash_exec` inherits the user's full shell environment: PATH, kubeconfig, gcloud auth, AWS profiles, SSH keys, and every tool installed on the machine. The tool description and system prompt now state this explicitly, and regression tests guard against the behaviour returning.
- **JP2 color space error leaking to terminal on image paste** — when pasting images via Ctrl+V on macOS, the `osascript` subprocess wrote macOS ImageIO's `*** Error creating a JP2 color space: falling back to sRGB` warning directly to the terminal. Fixed by capturing subprocess stderr instead of inheriting it (same fix applied to `xclip` on Linux).

---

## [2.15.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Maven and Gradle project support across all tools** — Coco now works out of the box on Spring Boot, Quarkus, and any JVM project. All analysis tools auto-detect `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` and switch to the appropriate JVM workflow:
  - `run_tests`: runs `./mvnw test` or `./gradlew test`; parses Maven Surefire output (`Tests run: X, Failures: Y, Errors: Z`); supports `-Dtest=ClassName` / `--tests` filters from pattern param
  - `get_coverage`: reads JaCoCo CSV reports from `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv` (Maven) and `build/reports/jacoco/` (Gradle)
  - `run_linter`: tries `checkstyle:check` / `checkstyleMain` for JVM projects; gracefully returns no-linter result when Checkstyle plugin is not configured
  - `analyze_complexity`: detects Java method signatures in addition to JS/TS functions
  - `calculate_quality`: source file discovery returns `src/main/java/**/*.java` for JVM projects
- **`run_maven` tool** — dedicated tool for running Maven goals with `./mvnw` wrapper detection, streaming output, heartbeat, and configurable timeout. Supports extra args for module selection (`-pl stock-core`) and goal flags (`-DskipTests`)
- **`run_gradle` tool** — dedicated tool for running Gradle tasks with `./gradlew` wrapper detection, same streaming/heartbeat pattern
- **JVM support in quality pipeline** — `CoverageAnalyzer`, `CorrectnessAnalyzer`, and `QualityEvaluator` now handle Maven/Gradle projects without crashing; JaCoCo CSV is parsed for real coverage metrics; Surefire output is aggregated across all modules

### Improved
- **`grep_search` default file pattern** — expanded from `{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md,txt}` to include `.java`, `.py`, `.go`, `.rs` so searches work across all supported language stacks by default
- **Stack detector Gradle fix** — Gradle projects are no longer misidentified as Maven projects in the system prompt context enrichment; agent receives correct build tool and testing framework information
- **Agent loop stability** — `JSON.stringify` calls in token estimation wrapped in try/catch to prevent crashes on circular reference objects in tool results

---

## [2.14.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Agent loop stops silently on long conversations** — `checkAndCompactContext()` was called without the tool registry, causing the context token counter to underestimate usage by ~2,000 tokens per turn (tool catalog, memory, and skills were not counted). Context would silently balloon past the window limit, causing API errors or the agent to stop mid-task
- **PR review dumps thousands of lines to terminal** — the `review_code` tool included full raw diff hunks in its return value, which got serialized into the LLM's tool result and reproduced verbatim in the response. Now strips diff hunks from the result since findings are already extracted during analysis — the agent receives only summary, findings, and file metadata

---

## [2.14.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Unified system prompt rewritten to match Cursor/Claude Code quality** — complete rewrite of the agent system prompt based on analysis of leaked prompts from Cursor, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Devin, Windsurf, Augment Code, and Superpowers
  - Verification protocol: 5-step evidence gate with anti-rationalization rules ("Belief is not evidence")
  - Parallel tool execution: "DEFAULT IS PARALLEL" directive with concrete examples for 3-5x speedup
  - Systematic debugging protocol: 3-phase Investigate → Analyze → Fix with escalation after 3 failed attempts
  - Code style rules: naming, typing, nesting, comments (inspired by Cursor CLI's `<code_style>`)
  - Testing discipline: never modify existing tests, mandatory regression tests for bugfixes
  - Task planning: atomic steps, vertical slice implementation, verify after each step
  - Tone and brevity: no sycophancy, lead with answer, disagree when warranted
  - Error recovery classification: invalid input / transient / structural (replaces flat tool-specific list)
- **Prompt enhancers reference module** — modular prompt enhancement system with request classifier, enhancer registry, and token-budget composer. Retained as reference for the content merged into the unified prompt

### Improved
- **System prompt 52% smaller** — reduced from 14,543 to 6,921 chars while adding 6 new behavioral sections. Effective prompt with 88 tools: ~13,500 chars (~3,400 tokens), aligned with Cursor CLI
- **Codebase research directive consolidated** — merged duplicate "Proactive Code Reference Search" section into single "Codebase Research Before Changes" under Tool Strategy

### Fixed
- **Context token counter undercounting** — `updateContextTokens()` was counting only the raw base prompt, ignoring tool catalog, memory, skills, and quality loop injections (~2,000 tokens undercount per turn). Now accepts optional `toolRegistry` to count the actual effective system prompt, improving compaction timing accuracy
- **`checkAndCompactContext()` forwards toolRegistry** — the compaction decision path now uses the accurate token count instead of the underestimated fallback

---

## [2.13.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **OpenAI API rejects `max_tokens` for newer models** — GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o1, o3, o4, and chatgpt-4o model families require `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens` in the Chat Completions API. Sending the deprecated parameter causes 400 errors on some installations depending on SDK version
  - Add `buildMaxTokensParam()` helper that selects the correct parameter based on model
  - Fix `isAvailable()` health check to use Responses API for Responses-only models (e.g. `gpt-5.4-codex`)

---

## [2.13.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Codex provider tool calling** — full tool calling support for the ChatGPT OAuth (Codex) provider via the Responses API
  - Message conversion: `tool_use` → `function_call`, `tool_result` → `function_call_output`
  - SSE streaming with function call event parsing and argument accumulation
  - `fnCallBuilders` keyed by `item.id` (Responses API invariant)
  - Safe `AbortController` timeout pattern (no throw-in-setInterval crash)
  - `withRetry` wrapper for transient API errors on both `chat()` and `chatWithTools()`
  - Temperature pass-through to `buildRequestBody`

---

## [2.12.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **GPT-5.4 Codex model support** — add OpenAI's latest agentic coding model across all providers
  - New default model for OpenAI, Codex, and Copilot providers
  - Available in OpenRouter as `openai/gpt-5.4-codex`
  - Pricing: $2/M input, $8/M output (400K context window)
  - Previous models (gpt-5.3-codex and earlier) remain available as non-default options

---

## [2.11.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Stream timeout crashes the process** — `throw` inside `setInterval` was an unhandled exception that killed the Node.js process instead of propagating to the async generator. Affects all providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot). Now uses `AbortController` to safely abort the stream and propagate the timeout error through the normal error handling path
- **OpenAI provider cannot call tools with GPT-5+/Codex models** — these models require the Responses API (`/responses`) instead of Chat Completions (`/chat/completions`). The provider only had Chat Completions support, so the model would respond with text but never emit tool calls, causing the agent loop to exit silently. Added full Responses API routing and implementation
- **Copilot Responses API streaming drops tool call arguments** — the `fnCallBuilders` map was keyed by `call_id` but the streaming events reference items by `item_id` (the output item's `id`), causing argument accumulation to fail silently. Tool calls were emitted with empty inputs

### Improved

- **Copilot provider simplified** — removed ~200 lines of duplicated Responses API code by delegating to the parent `OpenAIProvider`. Copilot now only adds token refresh on top of the shared implementation

---

## [2.11.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot provider** — full provider integration with device flow authentication, isolated credential storage, and automatic Responses API routing for Codex/GPT-5+ models
  - 15 models across 3 families (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) via Copilot
  - Shared `getCopilotCredentialsPath()` utility for credential isolation
  - Defense-in-depth guard against `GITHUB_TOKEN` env bleeding into stored credentials
- **Auth isolation layer** — dedicated `src/auth/` module separating Copilot auth from OpenAI OAuth flows (credentials, tokens, and device flow fully independent)

### Improved

- **Model selector rendering** — truncate lines to terminal width to prevent stacked duplicate renders from line wrapping
- **Provider model catalog** — update all providers to March 2026 versions: Anthropic (claude-opus-4-6 alias), OpenAI (gpt-5.3-codex), Gemini (3.1-pro-preview)
- **Onboarding flow** — correctly handle Copilot as a cloud provider during configuration

### Fixed

- **Lint warning for Unicode ZWJ** — use alternation instead of character class for zero-width joiner sequences in renderer

## [2.10.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Specialized subagent system** — five role-based agents (explore, plan, worker, reviewer, general) with per-role tool whitelists and model selection for targeted task execution
- **Mid-task steering** — LLM classifier distinguishes STEER/MODIFY/QUEUE/ABORT intents, enabling real-time context injection between agent iterations without restarting
- **Best-of-N parallel solutions** — run N independent solution attempts in isolated worktrees, score each with quality evaluation, and pick the best result
- **Headless/CI mode** — new `-P` flag for non-interactive pipeline execution, enabling use in CI/CD workflows and scripts
- **Unix composability** — stdin piping support (`git diff | coco -P "review"`) for integrating with shell pipelines
- **Layered COCO.md configuration** — 4-level hierarchy (user/project/directory/local) for fine-grained agent behavior customization
- **Enhanced plan mode** — read-only exploration phase with approve-then-execute flow for safer architectural changes
- **Context compaction with focus preservation** — `/compact focus on X` retains relevant context while compressing the rest
- **Worktree manager** — built-in git worktree lifecycle management (create/merge/cleanup) for parallel feature development

### Fixed

- **Path traversal containment** — prevent file operations from escaping the project directory
- **setTimeout leak** — clean up dangling timers that could keep the process alive after exit
- **Worktree path collision** — detect and handle name conflicts when creating worktrees
- **Stdin timeout** — proper timeout handling for piped input in headless mode

---

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Codex-style colored diff rendering** — `diff` code blocks now render with full-width red/green background colors for removed/added lines, matching the style used by OpenAI Codex
  - Word-level highlighting on paired delete→add lines shows exactly which words changed using brighter backgrounds
  - Line numbers extracted from `@@ hunk` headers display alongside each diff line
  - Auto-detection of unified diff content in code blocks without an explicit `diff` language tag
  - Applies to both top-level and nested code blocks in markdown output

---

## [2.8.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **Agent loop stops silently without explaining why** — when the LLM hit the output token limit (`max_tokens`), the stream ended with no tool calls and the agent broke out of the loop without any user-visible message. Now auto-continues by saving partial text and injecting a continuation prompt so the response completes naturally
- **No notification when iteration limit is reached** — when the agent exhausted its tool iteration limit (default 25), the loop exited silently. Now displays a visible notice: _"Reached the iteration limit. You can say 'continue' to resume."_

### Improved

- **All providers now emit `stopReason` in stream done chunks** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, and Codex providers track the LLM's stop/finish reason during streaming and surface it to the agent loop, enabling informed decisions about why a response ended

---

## [2.8.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **REPL freeze during Anthropic/Kimi streaming** — the Anthropic provider (used by kimi-code) had no stream-level timeout; if the LLM stalled mid-stream the REPL would hang indefinitely and Ctrl+C would kill the process. Added activity-based timeout (120s, matching the OpenAI provider) to both `stream()` and `streamWithTools()` methods
- **Ctrl+C does not cancel Anthropic streams** — the AbortSignal from the agent loop is now passed through to the Anthropic SDK's `messages.stream()` call, so pressing Ctrl+C aborts the HTTP connection directly instead of waiting for the stuck generator to yield
- **REPL freeze during context compaction** — the compaction LLM call had no timeout, no abort support, and no visual feedback. Added a 30-second timeout, SIGINT handler, and spinner; on abort or timeout the REPL continues silently
- **History trimming corrupts tool_call/tool_result pairs** — `addMessage()` could slice the message history at a `tool_result` boundary, orphaning it from its preceding `tool_use` message and causing persistent API Error 400 loops. The trimming now walks back to the nearest non-tool_result boundary (same proven pattern used in the context compactor)

---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Comprehensive error recovery across all tools** — every tool now returns actionable recovery hints when errors occur, guiding the agent to the correct next step instead of showing raw error messages
  - 28 tools enriched with pattern-specific error detection and human-readable suggestions
  - Git tools detect 9 common failure patterns (merge conflicts, push rejections, missing refs, etc.)
  - Build tools include a `hint` field when builds fail, suggesting missing dependencies, syntax fixes, or permission issues
  - Bash safety blocks now name the specific rule violated and how to rewrite the command
  - File-not-found errors suggest similar files via fuzzy matching (Did you mean?)
- **AGENTS.md as universal fallback for agentic documentation** — subagents now discover and use AGENTS.md files as a documentation source

### Improved

- **Error humanizer expanded** — new pass-through rules prevent double-humanization of already-enriched messages; TypeScript error codes and SQLite errors now get contextual hints
- **System prompt error recovery strategies** — per-category guidance (git, build/test, permissions, command not found, database) helps the agent self-correct without user intervention
- **Quality tool honesty** — `run_linter` returns `score: null` with an explanatory message when no linter is detected, instead of a misleading perfect score of 100
- **Semantic search transparency** — warns when using fallback text matching instead of transformer embeddings, and reports skipped files
- **Code review warnings** — `review_code` now surfaces diff read failures and linter unavailability instead of silently skipping them

### Fixed

- **Status bar first-letter clipping** — add space after folder emoji to prevent the first character from being cut off in the terminal status line

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Multi-level subcommand support for bash permission patterns** — bash safety patterns now support matching multi-level subcommands for more granular permission control

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Context usage indicator** — a live token-usage bar is now shown in the REPL status line; a warning fires at 90 % and 95 % context capacity so you can compact or start a new session before the window overflows
- **Tool output visibility and intent narration** — tool calls now display their category and a short plain-English description of what the agent is about to do; tool results show a compact, readable summary instead of raw JSON; long outputs are truncated with a "show more" hint
- **Word-wrap in input** — long input lines now wrap at word boundaries within the terminal width, so multi-line prompts stay readable and the cursor stays in sync with what the terminal renders
- **Up/down arrows jump to line boundary before navigating history** — pressing ↑ while the cursor is in the middle of a multi-line input first moves to the start of the first line; pressing ↓ first moves to the end of the last line; only a second press navigates history, matching standard shell behaviour

### Fixed

- **Wrapped input eating terminal log lines** — when a long input wrapped across terminal columns and the cursor was moved, `countVisualRows` double-counted rows where a space landed at exactly column N (terminal auto-wrap + explicit `\n`), causing `cursorUp` to overshoot the separator and erase log lines on every keypress
- **ASCII art rendering outside markdown box** — ASCII diagrams generated inside a `~~~markdown` outer block used bare `~~~` as inner fence openers; since bare `~~~` closes the outer block, the diagram content leaked as plain text; inner blocks now use backtick fences (`` ```ascii ``, `` ```bash ``) which are structurally incapable of closing a tilde outer fence
- **Nested code block collision and table truncation** — a renderer state-machine bug caused `inNestedCodeBlock` to not reset correctly after a nested code block inside a markdown wrapper, which prevented the outer block from closing and corrupted table rendering; the state is now restored on both the open and close paths
- **Double Ctrl+C required to exit** — pressing Ctrl+C once now clears the current input line; a second press exits the REPL, matching the behaviour users expect from interactive shells
- **Spinner echo and permanent log cleanup** — the input echo was printed after the spinner started on the same line, causing leftover text in the log; the echo is now cleared before `spinner.stop()`, and trailing ellipsis characters are stripped from permanent log entries
- **ANSI wrap bleed across renderer segments** — bold/colour escape sequences started in one renderer segment could leak into the next line if the terminal wrapped mid-sequence; reset codes are now emitted at every line boundary

---

## [2.5.3] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Lifecycle hooks** — coco now loads `.coco/hooks.json` at startup and fires `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` hooks around every tool execution; hooks can inspect, modify, or block tool calls; startup is non-fatal if the file is absent

### Improved

- **Contextual spinner during agent turns** — the spinner now shows which quality-loop iteration is running and what tool category was just used (e.g. "Iter. 3 · after running tests · Analyzing results…"); previously it showed a generic time-based message with no context
- **`exit` / `quit` / `q` as bare keywords** — typing these without a leading `/` now exits the REPL immediately, matching user intuition

### Fixed

- **API Error 400 on context compaction** — the compactor could split a `tool_use` / `tool_result` pair across the summarise/preserve boundary, causing the next request to be rejected by the API; the boundary now always starts at or before the matching `tool_use` message
- **API Error 400 on missing tool results** — if a tool call was streamed but its execution result was dropped (e.g. internal ID mismatch), the next LLM request would be rejected; a placeholder `tool_result` with `is_error: true` is now injected automatically and a warning is logged
- **Tool argument data-bleed in Anthropic streams** — when a `content_block_stop` event was missing between two consecutive tool calls in the stream, the second tool's argument JSON would be appended to the first tool's input; the provider now detects the unclosed block and finalises it before starting the next tool
- **OpenAI-compatible providers losing tool calls on early stream exit** — tool calls were only finalised after the full stream loop, so any provider that closes the connection before sending all events (or omits `finish_reason`) would silently drop them; tool calls are now also finalised inline when `finish_reason` is received, with a fallback pass after the loop
- **OpenAI provider rejecting providers that omit the tool-call `index`** — some OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g. custom local inference servers) do not include the `index` field in streaming tool-call deltas; the provider now falls back to the current map size so each new tool call gets a unique slot
- **npm update check silently failing on slow connections** — the update check was fetching the full package manifest (~100 KB) with a 2 s timeout; slow connections would silently time out and no update notification would appear; the check now fetches only the `/latest` endpoint (~10 KB) and uses a 5 s timeout
- **Timer leak in update check** — the startup-timeout promise in `checkForUpdatesInteractive` was leaving a dangling `setTimeout` when the network call resolved first; it is now cancelled with `clearTimeout`
- **Bash heredoc false positives** — commands that write files via heredoc (`cat > /tmp/test.js << 'EOF' … EOF`) were incorrectly blocked as dangerous because JavaScript code inside the heredoc body (jQuery `$()`, backticks, `eval()`, "source of truth" comments) matched shell injection patterns; safety patterns that are sensitive to code content are now checked only against the shell command header, not the heredoc body

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Intent recognizer false positives** — natural language messages like "implementa la tarea de instructions.md" or "construye el proyecto según el plan" were incorrectly intercepted as COCO phase commands (`/task`, `/build`) with high confidence. Phase commands (`plan`, `build`, `task`, `init`, `output`, `ship`) are now excluded from the regex recognizer entirely; the LLM handles them naturally through its registered tools and slash-command routing. Only unambiguous control-flow keywords (`status`, `trust`, `help`, `exit`) remain in the pattern recognizer.
- **Exit prompt removed** — typing `exit` or `quit` now terminates the REPL immediately without asking for confirmation; previously it would show an interactive prompt before acting.

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Error humanizer** — technical error messages are now translated into plain English before being shown to the user; covers 20+ patterns across network errors (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ENOTFOUND`, SSL), filesystem (`ENOENT` with path extraction, `EACCES`, `EISDIR`), git (`not a git repository`, merge conflicts, push rejected), JSON parse failures, missing modules, command not found, and API auth errors (401/403/429/503)
- **LLM-powered error hints** — when an error doesn't match a known rule and still looks technically opaque (stack traces, Node.js `ERR_` codes, `TypeError`, etc.), an async LLM call fires non-blocking after the tool run; the plain-language explanation is printed as a dim `💡` hint once the agent turn completes, without blocking any output

### Fixed

- **Infinite loop on repeated tool errors** — when the same tool fails with the same error 3 or more consecutive times (e.g. `write_file` called with missing `path`/`content`), the agent now injects a directive telling the LLM to stop retrying and explain the issue to the user instead; previously the agent would loop up to 25 times silently
- **Zod validation errors shown as raw JSON** — tool parameter validation failures were displayed as unreadable JSON arrays; they now produce a readable message: `Invalid tool input — path (expected string), content (expected string)`
- **Input echo and action menu in Spanish** — the secondary input placeholder ("Escribe para modificar o añadir tareas…") and interruption menu labels ("Modificar", "Encolar", "Abortar") were in Spanish; all UI text is now English
- **`[Anthropic]` hardcoded in error messages** — a `console.warn` in the Anthropic provider included a `[Anthropic]` prefix that appeared even when using other providers (e.g. `kimi-code`); removed and replaced with the structured logger
- **Slow startup without internet** — the npm version check at startup could block for several seconds when offline or using a local LLM; a 2.5 s hard timeout now ensures coco always starts quickly regardless of network availability
- **Update prompt default was "No"** — pressing Enter at the "Exit now to update?" prompt now confirms the update (default changed to Yes)

### Improved

- **Spinner feedback during tool execution** — spinner messages are now descriptive per tool: "Generating file content…" (write_file), "Planning edits…" (edit_file), `Running: npm test…` (bash_exec with actual command), "Composing commit…" (git_commit), etc.; previously all tools showed a generic "Preparing: tool_name…" message
- **Dead code annotated** — the unreachable `case "open"` branch in `intentToCommand` is now clearly documented so future maintainers know it is kept intentionally for forward-compatibility

---

## [2.4.2] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Kimi For Coding 403 error (properly fixed)** — migrated `kimi-code` from the OpenAI-compatible endpoint to Kimi's official Anthropic-compatible endpoint (`https://api.kimi.com/coding`); the previous workaround (`User-Agent: claude-code` on the OpenAI endpoint) did not resolve the 403; the Anthropic SDK now talks directly to the Anthropic-protocol endpoint that Kimi officially supports for Claude Code and other Anthropic-SDK-based agents

---

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Qwen provider connection failure for international users** — the default API endpoint now points to `dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com` (the international DashScope endpoint used by `modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com`); China domestic users can override with `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL`
  - Updated across `env.ts`, `providers/index.ts`, and `providers-config.ts` for full consistency
  - Connection error hint now explains the two endpoints and the override path
- **Kimi For Coding 403 error** — requests to the `kimi-for-coding` model now include `User-Agent: claude-code`; the Kimi API requires this header to accept connections from coding agents
- **Provider switch not taking effect mid-session** — using `/provider` or `/model` to switch while the REPL is running now re-initialises the active provider object immediately; previously the old provider (e.g. `kimi-code`) remained active for the rest of the session even after switching, causing API errors on every subsequent turn
  - If re-initialisation fails, `session.config` is reverted to the previous provider so the session state stays consistent
- **Provider selector rendering corruption** — scrolling through the provider list when `kimi-code` was highlighted caused the `anthropic` row to appear duplicated multiple times; the selected-item second-line expansion was not accounted for in the line-counter used by `clearPrevious()`, leaving ghost lines that accumulated on each keystroke

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Alibaba Qwen provider** (`/provider` → Qwen) — DashScope OpenAI-compatible API; supports `qwen-coder-plus` (recommended), `qwen-max`, `qwen-plus`, `qwen-turbo`, `qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct`, and `qwq-plus`; configure via `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` (or `QWEN_API_KEY` as fallback)

### Fixed

- **Provider selector duplication** — moving the cursor or pressing Esc/Cancel left the first provider line (`anthropic`) duplicated on screen; fixed an off-by-one in `clearPrevious()` that skipped clearing the top line of the menu

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Auto-swarm complexity classification** — the swarm pipeline now classifies each feature's complexity before running reviews and selects the minimal necessary agent roster, instead of always running all 8 agents
  - Trivial (score 1–3): `tdd-developer` only
  - Simple (4–5): adds `qa`
  - Moderate (6–7): adds `architect`
  - Complex (8–10): adds `security-auditor` + `external-reviewer`
  - LLM-based classification with automatic heuristic fallback (word count, criteria count, dependency count, keyword signals)
  - `skipComplexityCheck` escape hatch forces the full roster; `complexityThreshold` sets a minimum level that always triggers the full roster
- **Per-project commit auto-approval** (`/permissions allow-commits`) — opt a specific project into auto-approving `git commit` without enabling it globally; revert with `/permissions revoke-commits`
- **`/permissions` command** — dedicated command for managing tool trust, applying the recommended template, and controlling per-project commit behaviour
  - `/permissions` — show current trust status (global + project tools, deny list)
  - `/permissions apply` — apply the recommended allow/deny template
  - `/permissions view` — view the full recommended template before applying
  - `/permissions reset` — clear all trusted tools (with confirmation)
  - `/permissions allow-commits` / `/permissions revoke-commits` — project-scoped commit auto-approval
- **Expanded recommended permissions template** — pnpm direct commands (`pnpm:install`, `pnpm:run`, `pnpm:test`, `pnpm:build`, …), JS/TS runners (`vitest`, `tsc`, `tsx`, `oxlint`), and additional build toolchain entries now included in the default allow-list

### Changed

- **`/coco` renamed to `/quality`** — the quality convergence mode command is now `/quality [on|off]`; `/coco` remains as a backward-compatible alias so existing workflows continue to work without changes
  - Config key migrated from `cocoMode` → `qualityLoop` with transparent fallback for existing configs

### Fixed

- **Worktree detection in `worktree-list`** — the script used `-d` to test for the `.git` entry, which failed for file-based `.git` refs used by worktrees; switched to `-e` so both regular checkouts and linked worktrees are detected correctly
- **API key not persisted after `/provider` switch** — switching provider via the interactive menu now writes the new API key to `~/.coco/.env`, matching the behaviour of the initial onboarding setup
- **Release workflow using non-existent GitHub Actions versions** — `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, `actions/upload-artifact`, and `actions/download-artifact` were pinned to `@v6` (which does not exist); corrected to `@v4`
- **OAuth success message showed "ChatGPT subscription" for all providers** — when switching to Gemini via OAuth the confirmation now correctly displays "Google account (OAuth)"
- **Circular dependency crash in swarm feature ordering** — `topologicalSort` had no cycle guard; a circular dependency between features would cause infinite recursion; now detects cycles early and throws a descriptive error

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **`/mcp` command** — interactive MCP server management directly from the REPL: list connected servers, add/remove servers, and toggle them on or off without restarting
- **`/intent` command** — display or reset the agent's current task intent; useful for confirming what the agent understood before it starts executing
- **`kimi-code` provider** (`KIMI_CODE_API_KEY`) — Kimi Code subscription endpoint (`api.kimi.com/coding/v1`), separate from the pay-per-token Moonshot Kimi provider; `paymentType: "sub"` for users on a monthly plan
- **MCP manager + skill discovery wired to REPL** — both the MCP server manager and the unified skill registry are now initialised at startup and available to all REPL commands
- **VS Code extension scaffolding** — initial extension structure (`feat(repl,vscode)`) enabling IDE integration
- **`checkForUpdatesInteractive()`** — displays the available update notice **before** opening the REPL (once per session). Replaces the inline check in `printWelcome()`
- **Persistent version cache** — version-check result written to `~/.coco/version-check-cache.json` (valid 24 h) instead of an env variable that reset each session
- **`parseCocoQualityReport(content)`** — extracted from `index.ts` to `coco-mode.ts` as a public tested function; parses the `COCO_QUALITY_REPORT` marker block into a typed `CocoQualityResult`; covered by 7 unit tests

### Changed

- **Welcome screen** now shows MCP server count, loaded skill count (builtin vs project), and trust level at startup — single compact block, no restarting required
- **MCP manager switched to singleton pattern** (`getMCPServerManager`) — prevents duplicate instantiation across REPL lifecycle
- **COCO mode routes through `coco-fix-iterate` skill when available** — checks skill registry first; falls back to text-protocol injection when skill is not found
- **`/coco status` shows active mode type** — displays `(skill-based)` or `(prompt-based)` depending on whether `coco-fix-iterate` was discovered
- **`looksLikeFeatureRequest()` threshold lowered** (40 → 20 chars) and four new keywords added (`fix … bug/issue/error/problem`, `update … function/component/service/module`, `generate`, `convert`) so more natural language requests are correctly classified as feature work
- **Git status shown in REPL welcome** — current branch and dirty-state indicator displayed at startup using project git context
- **`merge-back` skill runs `format:fix` both before and after merge** — eliminates CI Lint & Format failures caused by cross-branch formatting drift

### Fixed

- **System prompt silently dropped in Anthropic and Gemini providers** — added `extractSystem()` helper that falls back to scanning the messages array, so the agent-loop system prompt is now reliably forwarded on every call
- **Tool-trust `ask` action wrote to deny list** — the `ask` branch no longer persists the decision to disk; it only removes the tool from the session's trusted set

### Documentation

- **README** — added `## Privacy` section and provider comparison table (Coco vs Aider vs Claude Code vs Cursor)
- **`docs/guides/QUICK_START.md`** — fully rewritten for v2 REPL-first flow; removed stale `coco init/plan/build` references
- **`docs/guides/ECOSYSTEM.md`** — added skill discovery priority order section
- **`SECURITY.md`** — supported versions updated to `2.0.x` / `2.1.x`
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — repository URL corrected to `github.com/corbat-tech/coco`
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — `[Unreleased]` comparison link fixed, Spanish bullet points translated

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

#### Unified Skills System (Fork 3 — upgrade-version-2)
- **`createUnifiedSkillRegistry`** — multi-scope discovery loading skills from global (`~/.claude/skills/`), project (`.coco/skills/`), and built-in sources automatically
- **Project-local skills** in `.coco/skills/` — committed alongside source code, scoped to the repo
- **YAML/JSON skill format** support alongside Markdown `SKILL.md` files
- **`skill-enhancer`** — enriches skill context before injection, adding codebase-specific metadata
- **Automatic skill discovery** — zero-config; new files in watched directories are picked up at runtime

#### WSL Support & Security (Fork 2 — extra)
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** detection and path translation — coco now works natively inside WSL2 environments
- **`execFile` security fix** — replaced `exec` with `execFile` for all subprocess calls, eliminating shell-injection risk in path-handling code

- **Java quality analyzers** (`src/quality/analyzers/java/`)
  - `JavaComplexityAnalyzer` — cyclomatic complexity per method, class metrics
  - `JavaSecurityAnalyzer` — OWASP pattern detection (SQL injection, hardcoded credentials, unsafe deserialization, path traversal, XXE)
  - `JavaDocumentationAnalyzer` — Javadoc coverage for public methods and classes
  - `registerJavaAnalyzers(registry, projectPath)` for plugin registration

#### Project-Level Configuration (Phase 4.1)

  - Schema: `name`, `version`, `description`, `language`, `quality` overrides, `analyzers` (Java/React), `extend`
  - Config inheritance via `extend` field (relative path to base config, arrays concatenated, scalars override)
  - `loadProjectConfig(projectPath)` — loads and resolves inheritance chain
  - `saveProjectConfig(config, projectPath)` — writes validated config
  - `validateProjectConfig(raw)` — Zod-based validation returning typed result
  - `mergeProjectConfigs(base, override)` — explicit merge utility
  - `createDefaultProjectConfig(name, language?)` — factory for new projects
  - All symbols re-exported from `src/config/index.ts`

#### Quality Bridge (Phase 4.2)
- **`src/quality/quality-bridge.ts`** — translates `ProjectConfig` into internal quality types
  - `resolvedThresholds(config)` → `QualityThresholds` (merges `minScore`, `minCoverage`, `securityThreshold`, `maxIterations`)
  - `resolvedWeights(config)` → `QualityWeights` (normalised to sum 1.0)
  - `resolvedConvergenceOptions(config)` → `ConvergenceOptions`
  - `thresholdsFromProjectConfig`, `mergeThresholds`, `weightsFromProjectConfig`, `convergenceOptionsFromProjectConfig` — composable helpers
  - `DEFAULT_CONVERGENCE_OPTIONS` exported constant

#### Quality Formatter (Phase 4.3)
- **`src/quality/quality-formatter.ts`** — terminal ASCII quality reports (no ANSI colours, CI-friendly)
  - `QualityFormatter` class with `formatSummary`, `formatTable`, `formatIssues`, `formatSuggestions`, `formatFull`
  - Box-drawing table with score bars (`█░`) and per-dimension pass/fail icons
  - Severity-prefixed issue list; suggestions sorted by priority then estimated impact

#### Report Exporter (Phase 4.4)
- **`src/quality/report-exporter.ts`** — multi-format quality report export
  - `QualityReportExporter` class with `toJson`, `toMarkdown`, `toHtml`, `saveReport`
  - JSON: pretty-printed, serialisable
  - Markdown: tables + issues + suggestions + footer
  - HTML: self-contained with inline CSS, progress bars, XSS-safe (`htmlEscape`)
  - `saveReport` persists to `.coco/reports/quality-<ISO-timestamp>.<ext>`

#### GitHub Actions Integration (Phase 5)
- **`src/phases/output/github-quality-workflow.ts`** — YAML workflow generator
  - `generateQualityWorkflow(options)` — produces `.github/workflows/quality.yml`
  - Supports `nodeVersion`, `packageManager` (pnpm/npm/yarn), `failOnBelowMinimum`, `commentOnPR`, `branches`
  - pnpm setup step only included when `packageManager === "pnpm"`
  - `continue-on-error` only set when `failOnBelowMinimum === false`
  - `formatQualityPRComment(evaluation, options)` — Markdown PR comment with collapsible `<details>` blocks

- **6 new LLM providers** added to provider support:
  - **Groq** (`GROQ_API_KEY`) — Llama 4, Mixtral, Gemma; ultra-low latency inference
  - **OpenRouter** (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) — 200+ models via unified OpenAI-compatible API
  - **Mistral AI** (`MISTRAL_API_KEY`) — Mistral Large, Codestral (code-optimised)
  - **DeepSeek** (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) — DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1 (reasoning)
  - **Together AI** (`TOGETHER_API_KEY`) — Llama 4, Qwen, Falcon; pay-per-token
  - **Hugging Face** (`HF_API_KEY`) — any HF Inference Endpoint

#### Test Infrastructure (Phase 7)
- **Java fixture project** (`test/fixtures/java-project/`)
  - `UserService.java` — well-documented, security-clean service
  - `VulnerableService.java` — intentional OWASP vulnerabilities (SQL injection, hardcoded creds, unsafe deserialization)
  - `.coco.config.json` with `minScore: 70`, `maxIterations: 5`
- **React fixture project** (`test/fixtures/react-project/`)
  - `UserCard.tsx` — fully-typed, a11y-correct, hooks-compliant component
  - `BadComponent.tsx` — missing key, missing alt, no keyboard support
  - `.coco.config.json` with React analyzer options
- **Integration test suite** (`test/integration/quality-pipeline.test.ts`) — 27 tests covering the full pipeline end-to-end (config load → language detection → analyzers → registry → exporter/formatter) using real fixture files, zero mocks

### Changed
- **Provider table** in README expanded from 6 to 12 providers
- **Known Limitations** — removed "TypeScript/JavaScript first" limitation (Java/React now fully supported)
- **Test count** updated to 5,100+
- **`src/cli/repl/index.ts` modularisation** — 5 heavy static imports converted to lazy dynamic imports (`createLLMClassifier`, `loadFullAccessPreference`, `createConcurrentCapture`, `createFeedbackSystem`, `createInputEcho`); 4 unnecessary `export * from` re-exports removed, reducing startup memory footprint
- **Test configuration** — `src/cli/repl/index.test.ts` excluded from standard vitest run (interactive REPL causes OOM in headless worker environments); `pool: "forks"` set for improved isolation; `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096'` applied to all test scripts

### Fixed
- **Post-merge import breakage** (Fork 4 — solve-bugs) — corrected broken import paths introduced during the 4-fork merge; removed leftover dead code and stale type references
- **`/open` command** — restored correct file-open behaviour in REPL after CLI refactor

### Documentation (Phase 6)
